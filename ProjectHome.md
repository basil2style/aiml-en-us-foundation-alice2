ALICE 2.0 is a new (as of 2014) version of the AIML chatbot <a href='http://alice.pandorabots.com'>ALICE</a> designed for the mobile era.  You can use<br>

applications.    The original ALICE bot has some problems and issues that make it difficult to adapt to new applications, however, for example:<br>

  * ALICE contains satirical and political content that is unsuitable for many commercial applications.
  * ALICE contains a number of AIML experiments that led nowhere, but the code still contains these experiments.

  * The file organization of ALICE is poor, making it hard to edit and revise the bot's content.
  * ALICE uses AIML 1.0.1 and does not take advantage of newer AIML 2.0 and 2.1 features.
